# About me Page

00. Oscar FM - Portugal - Birds of Fire 
01. I am not a computer programmer but sometimes I program brains. ( my own or yours ) 
02. I am not a computer guy, but I use Linux for more than 20 years. 
03. I am no god or similar, while I have this crazy illusion I am here to do some "Shamanic Quest Dream" about the "way" ( Tao / Dao ) .. which is one of the oldest theories about "God". 
04. I am not the King of the Jungle! ( Monkey cannot be unfair to the weak ) 
05. I am a social guy.. lets talk about anything you wish to. 
06. I love all kind of Music Styles, Dances, Food, Painting, Travel-destinations, etc... 
07. I love to write creative text, which aims to be more deep than simply creativity.
08. I do not love, violence, wars, and any kind of technique which doesn't solve problems! 
09. I do a lot of jokes ( Monkey is making questions about reality when Joke with it.. ) some with bad taste
10. Not a Philosopher or Psychologist, but monkey cannot deny the simplicity / complexity of the Brain. 

  ```
  Someone will can you today. 
  ```
11. The probability is one to many, and any brain can make the relations between that afirmation, associating meaning (abstraction / creativity / imagination) to explain that probability, which can be in fact, logical. Call it Mystical.. :p

# Skills
0. Read. Monkey have Eyes and when they are open, Monkey can only read.

# Common Sense is Not Intelligence 
1. Programmers Read, Copy, Think and re-write by the same "rule". 
2. Children Behave by the same Rule.
3. Scientist's did pass the same process. 

# Common aspects within all

0. Solipsism is a false theory but we all live in that condition.
1. How much "truthness" is in the ones who believe so hard is their self's, that exclude them self's from others to reach their objective? 
2. All talk about anything, even if they  don't know anything about it. 
- Hack what you don't know by interacting with the content without knowing the content
- Hacking or even learning is always done by the same process in all levels of knowledge and society.
